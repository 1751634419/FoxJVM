# FoxJVM
> THIS PROJECT REMAINS ***INCOMPLETE*** AND IS STILL ***FAR FROM RUNNING NORMALLY***
#Brief Introduction
*FoxJVM*, programmed by William Fox, is a virtual machine written in Rust, conforming to *The Java Virtual Machine Specification, Java SE 14 Edition*.

#The Current Planning(09/20/2020)
1. The virtual machine is going to be enabled to run hello-world program normally.
2. The unsafe code is going to be rewritten in a safer way.
3. Rather than providing with the means of bridging JNI and the VM, several necessary native methods will be implemented in Rust.

*It is estimated that the aforementioned objects are going to be implemented in three to four months most probably.*

#The Much Further Planning
1. Give it a shot for the implementation of JNI
2. Why not run Minecraft Client/Server on it?
3. Reconstruct parts of the project to optimize the efficiency.
