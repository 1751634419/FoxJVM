> THIS PROJECT REMAINS ***INCOMPLETE*** AND IS STILL ***FAR FROM RUNNING NORMALLY***


## Brief Introduction
*FoxJVM*, programmed by William Fox, is a virtual machine written in Rust, conforming to *The Java Virtual Machine Specification, Java SE 14 Edition*.

## Of Planning


### The Current Planning(09/20/2020)
1. The virtual machine is going to be enabled to run hello-world program normally.
2. The unsafe code is going to be rewritten in a safer way.
3. Rather than providing with the means of bridging JNI and the VM, several necessary native methods will be implemented in Rust.

*It is estimated that the aforementioned objects are going to be implemented in approximately three months most probably.*


### The Much Further Planning
1. Give it a shot for the implementation of JNI
2. Why not run Minecraft Client/Server on it?
3. Reconstruct parts of the project to optimize the efficiency.

# FAQ
### Q: Is the implementation of JVM planning to go into operation?
A: No, it is currently by no means an operational one for operating.

### Q: What is the project written for?
A: Just for fun. You may join me whenever you'd like to.
